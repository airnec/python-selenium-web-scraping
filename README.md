This project is solely for demonstration purposes and has been built upon what is taught in an AppBrewery course.

The main idea behind is to go ahead to a webpage, get the data, and use it to show something using Selenium WebDriver.

It contains the following basics:\
--> Setting up a Selenium WebDriver\
--> Configuring the driver options\
--> Digging into HTML code to find elements\
--> Manipulating dictionary and appending elements into it\
--> for loop\
--> Displaying the upcoming events
